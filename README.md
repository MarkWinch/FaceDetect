# FaceDetect

FaceDetect is a desktop application developed using the PyQt5 framework and the OpenCV library. It allows the user to select images, and will create a new directory containing the images which have people in them.

The main use of this application is targeted towards managing large folders of photos which are time consuming to sort through manually, such as vacation photos, where a user would want to select photos only including themselves or other people.
